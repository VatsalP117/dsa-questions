given an array of numbers and a value x, what is the max value of arr[i] ^ x?

Approach:
1. Insert all numbers into the trie in the form of binary bits 
Insertion should be de done from right to left (MSB to LSB)
2. Take x and find max number from array where (number^x) is max

How to maximimize xor?
say x=8= 01000 (assume only 5 bits)

0 1 0 0 0
_ _ _ _ _ which is this number for max xor??

for msb (start for left to right), do we have someone with bit=1? (since 0^1 =1)
then move to next bit, do we have someone with bit=0, then next and next..
