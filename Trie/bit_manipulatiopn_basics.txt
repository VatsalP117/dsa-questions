Integers are stored in 32 bits and long long in 64 bits (generally)
so binary repersentation of 9= 000...1001 (28 zeros before 1001)
indexing starts from right(LSB) to left(MSB)

XOR
1^0 = 1
0^1 = 1
1^1 = 1
0^0 = 0
GENERALLY, even number of 1's ka XOR = 0
odd number of 1's ka XOR= 1

Check if ith bit is set or not(assuming 1st bit,i=1 means LSB i.e 1based indexing)
(num>>(i-1)) & 1 !=0 means it is set

How to turn on ith bit?
eg make the 3rd bit set(assuming 1 based indexing)
(num | (1<<i-1) )
